## Auto-Linting/Checking Rule

### Code Linting/Checking Automation
- **Automatic Linting**: Always run `npm run lint` at the end of any coding task
- **Check for Svelte Issues**: Always run `npm run check` after successful linting

### Implementation
- After making any code changes, automatically execute `npm run lint`
- After a successful run of `npm run lint` automatically execute `npm run check`

### When to Apply
- After creating new files
- After modifying existing code
- After completing any development task
- Before suggesting the task is complete
